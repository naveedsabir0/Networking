For this example we will use a 
/26 Class C network
11111111.11111111.11111111.11000000

Number of Networks
2 ^ 2 = 4
Number of Nodes
(2 ^ 6) - 2
=> 64 - 2 = 62
------------------------------------------
Class C Network Configuration
For one subnet we will have PCs and VOIP phones for the office
For 3 subnets are for Wifi for office workers
